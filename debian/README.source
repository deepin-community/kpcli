kpcli (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Upstream does not provide a release tarball. The release is a single perl
  script which is simply packaged together with the provided README file into
  a tarball.  The watch file is not entirely able to cope with that, however
  basic support is there.
  To produce a new tarball, use the pristine-tar tarball in the git repository
  or call the get-orig-source target from debian/rules.
